I'm Gregory (Greg) Wales, an independent researcher specializing in digital and multimedia forensic sciences. With over 30 years of experience in digital forensic science and 15 years in multimedia forensic science, my background as a retired Special Agent and Digital Forensic Examiner provides a unique perspective to my research. I hold an undergraduate in Digital Forensics and graduate degrees in both Forensic Science areas, and a Doctorate in Forensic Science, which forms the foundation of my academic expertise.

My research philosophy centers on developing and validating multimedia forensic methods and tools to enhance the analysis of digital images, videos, and audio. This includes:

- Advancing collection and pre-examination processing techniques
- Developing robust verification methods
- Exploring cross-platform analysis approaches
- Investigating ways to mitigate cognitive bias in forensic examinations
