### More Information

Overall Forensic Research Philosophy: My research philosophy centers on developing and validating multimedia forensic methods and tools to enhance the forensic analysis of digital images, videos, and audio. This includes focusing on collection and pre-examination processing, verification techniques, cross-platform analysis, and cognitive bias mitigation. This overarching approach drives my commitment to advancing forensic science through rigorous, transparent, and reproducible methodologies, ultimately contributing to the integrity and reliability of forensic evidence in legal and investigative contexts.
