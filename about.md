# About Ronin 4n6Labs

**Ronin 4n6Labs** is the personal research identity of **Gregory S. Wales**, DFS, an independent digital and multimedia forensic scientist. Now retired and unaffiliated, I use this space to pursue open, transparent, and reproducible forensic science research without institutional constraints.

My work centers on:

- **Independent forensic method validation**
- **Digital and multimedia forensic research**
- **Empirical testing of forensic workflows and procedures**
- **Forensic ML method research, diagnostic behavior, and error‑rate characterization**
- **Open‑source validation pipelines and reproducible documentation**

Ronin 4n6Labs is **not** a company, business, or service provider.  I do not take clients, offer services, sell products, or receive funding. My work is entirely independent and motivated solely by improving the scientific foundations of digital and multimedia forensic science. Ronin 4n6Labs is simply the banner under which I publish my independent research, validation studies, and open‑source tools.

## Background

I’m Gregory (Greg) Wales, **a** retired federal law enforcement digital forensic examiner with over 30 years of experience in digital forensic science and more than 16 years in multimedia forensic science. I hold an undergraduate degree in *Computer Forensics & Digital Investigations*, graduate degrees in *Digital Forensic Science* and *Recording Arts with an emphasis in Multimedia Forensic Science*, and a *Doctor of Forensic Science (DFS)*. My background informs a research philosophy grounded in scientific rigor, empirical testing, and reproducible methodology.

## About My Research

My research focuses on the scientific reliability of digital and multimedia forensic methods. I work independently, without institutional or commercial influence, which allows me to examine forensic procedures with complete transparency and methodological rigor. My goal is to strengthen the scientific foundations of digital evidence by developing, testing, and validating methods that are reproducible, empirically grounded, and defensible in legal contexts.

I emphasize **method validation**, not tool promotion. This includes evaluating the behavior, limitations, and diagnostic performance of forensic workflows themselves — particularly how they perform across platforms, conditions, and implementations. My work also extends into **forensic machine learning**, where I study model behavior, error characteristics, and the scientific requirements for explainability and reliability.

Key themes in my research include:

- **Independent forensic method validation**
- **Empirical testing of digital, multimedia, and forensic ML workflows**
- **Cross‑platform and cross‑codec behavior in audio, image, and video evidence**
- **Error‑rate characterization and diagnostic performance analysis**
- **Transparent, reproducible, open‑source validation pipelines**
- **Mitigating cognitive bias in forensic examinations**
- **Understanding the scientific limits of emerging forensic technologies**

Through Ronin 4n6Labs, I share research, tools, and validation studies that contribute to a more transparent and scientifically defensible future for digital and multimedia forensics.
