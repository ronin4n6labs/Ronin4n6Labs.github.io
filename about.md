# About Ronin 4n6Labs

**Ronin 4n6Labs** is the personal research identity of **Gregory S. Wales**, DFS, an independent digital and multimedia forensic scientist. Now retired and unaffiliated, I use this space to pursue open, transparent, and reproducible forensic science research without institutional constraints.

My work centers on:

- **Independent forensic method validation**  
- **Digital and multimedia forensic research**  
- **Empirical testing of forensic workflows and procedures**  
- **Forensic ML method research, diagnostic behavior, and error‑rate characterization**  
- **Open‑source validation pipelines and reproducible documentation**

Ronin 4n6Labs is **not** a company, business, or service provider. I do not take clients, offer services, sell products, or receive funding. My work is entirely independent and motivated solely by improving the scientific foundations of digital and multimedia forensic science. Ronin 4n6Labs is simply the banner under which I publish my independent research, validation studies, and open‑source tools.

## Background

I’m Gregory (Greg) Wales, retired federal law enforcement and digital forensic examiner with over 30 years of experience in digital forensic science and more than 16 years in multimedia forensic science. I hold an undergraduate degree in *Computer Forensics & Digital Investigations*, graduate degrees in *Digital Forensic Science* and *Recording Arts with an emphasis in Multimedia Forensic Science*, and a *Doctor of Forensic Science (DFS)*. My background informs a research philosophy grounded in scientific rigor, empirical testing, and reproducible methodology.

## Mission Statement

*Ronin 4n6Labs advances the scientific foundations of digital, multimedia, and forensic machine learning through independent, transparent, and reproducible research. My mission is to develop and validate forensic methods that are empirically grounded, scientifically rigorous, and aligned with the reliability expectations of the courts. I pursue this work without commercial influence, institutional constraints, or advocacy — only a commitment to strengthening forensic science through evidence, clarity, and methodological integrity.*

## About My Research

My research focuses on the scientific reliability of digital and multimedia forensic methods. I work independently, without institutional or commercial influence, which allows me to examine forensic procedures with complete transparency and methodological rigor. My goal is to strengthen the scientific foundations of digital evidence by developing, testing, and validating methods that are reproducible, empirically grounded, and defensible in legal contexts.

My approach to method validation is reflected in my recent publication in the *Journal of Forensic Sciences* — *A research‑focused framework for empirical method validation in digital and multimedia evidence* (Wales, 2026). This work outlines a structured, reproducible methodology for evaluating forensic workflows and serves as a foundation for the broader research programs I continue to develop through Ronin 4n6Labs.

I emphasize **method validation**, not tool promotion. This includes evaluating the behavior, limitations, and diagnostic performance of forensic workflows themselves — particularly how they perform across platforms, conditions, and implementations. My work also extends into **forensic machine learning**, where I study model behavior, error characteristics, and the scientific requirements for explainability and reliability.

Key themes in my research include:

- **Independent forensic method validation**  
- **Empirical testing of digital, multimedia, and forensic ML workflows**  
- **Cross‑platform and cross‑codec behavior in audio, image, and video evidence**  
- **Error‑rate characterization and diagnostic performance analysis**  
- **Transparent, reproducible, open‑source validation pipelines**  
- **Mitigating cognitive bias in forensic examinations**  
- **Understanding the scientific limits of emerging forensic technologies**

Through Ronin 4n6Labs, I share research, tools, and validation studies that contribute to a more transparent and scientifically defensible future for digital and multimedia forensics.

## The Ronin Philosophy

*The Ronin is a practitioner without a master — free to follow evidence, not agendas. Ronin 4n6Labs reflects that philosophy. I work independently so I can examine forensic methods with honesty, rigor, and transparency, unbound by institutional pressures or commercial interests. My goal is not to defend tools or promote technologies without scientific scrutiny, but to understand the forensic methods they are intended to implement — to test those methods, evaluate their behavior, conduct empirical validation, and document their strengths, limitations, and scientific reliability. Forensic science serves the courts and the public, and it deserves methods that are reproducible, validated, and scientifically sound. The Ronin path is straightforward: follow the data, expose and characterize the error sources, and develop method controls that mitigate their impact — letting the science speak for itself. This approach defines how I structure my validation studies and evaluate forensic algorithms in practice.*

## The Ronin 4n6Labs Research Portfolio

Ronin 4n6Labs maintains a long‑term, independent research portfolio organized into three programs. These programs build on the empirical validation methodology demonstrated in my recent JFS publication and extend that approach across digital, multimedia, and forensic ML domains. My goal is to conduct meaningful research in each program and publish **value‑added scientific work** that benefits the forensic community.

### **1. Ronin Digital Foundations Program**  
Scientific validation of digital evidence workflows.  
Current and emerging projects include:

- Windows file deletion validation  
- File carving validation  

### **2. Ronin Multimedia Evidence Program**  
Empirical validation of audio, image, and video evidence workflows.  
Projects include:

- Forensic integrity of images embedded in PDF files  
- Audio stream hashing validation  
  - Error exploratory and mitigation development  
- Video frame extraction integrity validation  
  - H.265 frame extraction method development  
- Video stream hashing validation (long‑term)

### **3. Ronin Forensic ML Program**  
Transparency, error architecture, and reproducibility in forensic machine learning.  
Projects include:

- **Forensic XAI ML Framework**  
  - Framework development  
  - Forensic XAI ML proof‑of‑concept studies  

- **Core Error Architecture of Forensic ML**  
  - Error‑source taxonomy development  
  - Alignment with scientific and legal reliability requirements  

- **Numerical Stability & Machine‑Epsilon Sensitivity Study**  
  - Cross‑platform drift analysis  
  - Forensic impact on model decisions
