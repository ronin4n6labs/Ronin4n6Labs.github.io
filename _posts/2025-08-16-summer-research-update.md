Hi everyone,

It’s been a busy summer! Since my last post on May 26th, I have been deeply involved in teaching three graduate courses at UC Denver’s NCMF, wrapping up two research studies, and preparing manuscripts for potential publication in a forensic science journal. Alongside this, I’ve been transforming some of my doctoral coursework research into a proposed technical note paper.

Given this full plate, it took me a bit longer to finalize new blog content, but I’m excited to share that the next post is nearly ready. The upcoming post builds on our previous discussion of descriptive statistics with data visualization of a couple of those descriptive tests. It will include a short descriptive statistics dataset in CSV format and two Python scripts (one for box plots and another combining skewness and kurtosis visualizations) so you can engage directly with the data.

Beyond that, the post introduces a research-focused framework for empirical forensic method validation, kicking off a multi-part series aimed at advancing both scientific rigor and legal reliability in digital and multimedia evidence analysis.

Thanks for your patience and continued interest—I look forward to sharing these new insights and practical tools with you soon!
