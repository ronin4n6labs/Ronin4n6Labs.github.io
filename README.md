# Ronin 4n6Labs GitHub Pages Site

This repository hosts the GitHub Pages site for **Ronin 4n6Labs**, the personal research identity of **Gregory S. Wales**, DFS — an independent digital and multimedia forensic scientist.

The site contains:

- Public research notes and documentation  
- Forensic method validation work  
- Digital, multimedia, and forensic ML research summaries  
- Open‑source validation pipelines and reproducible workflows  
- Project pages, blog posts, and supporting materials  

Ronin 4n6Labs is **not** a company, business, or service provider.  
I do not take clients, offer services, sell products, or receive funding.  
This space exists solely to support transparent, independent forensic science research.

The site is built using GitHub Pages and Jekyll.  
All content is maintained in this repository.
