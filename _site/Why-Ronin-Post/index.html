    <h2 id="welcome-to-my-research---who-i-am--my-research-focus">Welcome to My Research - Who I Am &amp; My Research Focus</h2>

<h3 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h3>

<p>I am an independent researcher in multimedia forensic science, focusing on verifying and validating forensic methods. Unlike traditional digital forensic science, which broadly covers file system analysis, memory forensics, and malware analysis, multimedia forensic science focuses on audio, image, and video authentication, manipulation detection, and methodological enhancement.</p>

<p>I operate as a Ronin—an independent researcher, free from institutional or corporate funding constraints. While I may not share all of my advanced test measurement instruments, I aim to provide foundational tools to promote transparency and reproducibility in the field. For instance, I plan to offer methods like image subtraction combined with Pearson correlation coefficient (CC) scoring to verify the accuracy of image stream hashes. My mission is to rigorously evaluate forensic methodologies, develop open-source tools for unbiased research, reliability, and repeatability, and advocate for higher scientific rigor in multimedia forensics.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="why-multimedia-forensic-science">Why Multimedia Forensic Science?</h3>

<p>Multimedia forensic science is often grouped under the broader digital forensic science but presents its own distinct challenges. While digital forensics focuses on structured data, multimedia forensic science requires signal processing, pattern recognition, and deep learning approaches to analyze audio, image, and video content.</p>

<p>Despite the importance of multimedia forensics, the field faces a significant gap in independent scientific scrutiny. Many commercially developed and proprietary forensic tools limit transparency and independent validation. Furthermore, rigorous validation studies in specific low-hanging fruit areas or processes that may change or influence the results are scarce, leaving forensic results open to skepticism without proper validation. This blog aims to bridge that gap by championing transparency, reproducibility, and trust in multimedia forensic science.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="trust-but-verify-the-need-for-independent-research">Trust But Verify: The Need for Independent Research</h3>

<p>In forensic science, practitioners often depend on <strong>“point-and-click”</strong> software applications that streamline analysis. While these tools are convenient, they come with risks. Systematic errors can occur if forensic tools are used without considering the specific nuances of each case. These errors may compromise the accuracy of results, with serious implications in legal proceedings.</p>

<p>My approach focuses on rigorous testing of forensic tools through scientifically validated methodologies. By using scientifically validated methods, we ensure that results are accurate and reliable and meet the stringent standards set by the Daubert standard [1] and Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 702 [2]. These legal frameworks establish the necessity of reliability, peer review, error rates, and scientific validity when presenting forensic evidence in court. By adhering to these principles, we can strengthen forensic evidence, making it robust and defensible in court while championing the ideals of scientific rigor and methodological transparency. Independent research complements institutional efforts by providing an additional layer of validation, ensuring that forensic methodologies continue to evolve and meet the highest standards of reliability and reproducibility.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="why-ronin"><strong>Why Ronin?</strong></h4>

<p>The term ‘Ronin’ originates from feudal Japan. It refers to samurai who found themselves without a master, often due to losing their masters in battle or political upheaval. Some chose this path voluntarily, seeking greater autonomy or breaking away due to personal conflicts. In both cases, Ronin symbolized adaptability, resilience, and a commitment to forging their way.</p>

<p>In a modern context, ‘Ronin’ represents independence, self-reliance, and an unwavering commitment to one’s principles. It embodies my philosophy of <strong><em>Truth in Multimedia Forensic Science—Trust But Verify</em></strong> and the resolve to remain free from external influences. This concept is especially relevant to independent research in multimedia forensics, where objective scrutiny can complement institutional efforts by providing an additional validation layer. While traditional forensic research conducted within institutions plays a crucial role, independent researchers bring fresh perspectives, challenge assumptions, and enhance methodological transparency—ensuring that forensic science continues to evolve with rigorous scrutiny and innovation.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Ronin in Multimedia Forensics</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Independence:</strong> Like Ronin, independent researchers in multimedia forensics work free from the constraints of formal institutions, allowing them greater flexibility to pursue innovative topics and methodologies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Self-Reliance:</strong> Ronin were famed for their resourcefulness. Independent researchers similarly depend on their own skills, tools, and networks, often operating without the support structures found in larger organizations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Commitment to Excellence:</strong> The Ronin’s dedication to their craft mirrors independent researchers’ unwavering pursuit of high scientific standards. Rigorous methods and transparency ensure their contributions meet the demands of a rapidly evolving field.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Ronin thrived by adjusting to changing circumstances. Independent researchers must also be agile, navigating challenges such as limited resources, interdisciplinary demands, and access barriers while delivering impactful results.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Community Contribution:</strong> Despite their autonomy, Ronin often served their communities. Independent researchers share valuable tools, insights, and findings in the same spirit, enriching the broader forensic science landscape. While I value my independence, I am open to collaborating with universities, government entities, or other organizations if opportunities arise—provided such collaboration respects my commitment to impartiality, methodological transparency, and the principle of <strong>Trust But Verify.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>By embodying the Ronin spirit, I aim to break new ground in multimedia forensic science. Independence allows me to adapt creatively, embrace innovation, and contribute meaningfully to the field. Much like the Ronin samurai, I navigate challenges resiliently, ensuring that my work remains rigorous, impactful, and true to my guiding principles.</p>
